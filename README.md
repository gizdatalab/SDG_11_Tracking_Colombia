# Tracking Urbanization for sustainable development in Colombia
SDG Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

For most of human history, population lived in very low-density rural areas, now for several decades Cities all over the world are expanding. Today, half of the population lives in cities and, according to current estimates, two-thirds will do so by the middle of this century. That is 6.5 billion people living in cities and about half of the area has yet to be built. Good urban planning significantly influences the lives of the people. The creation of living space, community areas, infrastructure determines how we live together. Rapid urbanization is often accompanied by unplanned and informal city development which leads to social and economic segregation and areas of poverty and insecurity. This not only worsens living situation, subsequent creation of public spaces or an adequate infrastructure planning is also significantly more expensive. In fact, a large share of development aid to cities is spent on retrofitting infrastructure (source). The goal is to get ahead of the curve for a sustainable city planning bevor development is happening. The topic is also reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations â€“ SDG 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.
